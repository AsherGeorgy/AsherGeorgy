# Hi there, I'm Asher 

I'm a finance professional turned tech enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.

## 🚢 My Journey

### 🖥️ The Beginning: Exploring Excel

My journey into programming started unexpectedly. It all began when I wanted to create a tool to predict EPL and NBA scores using Excel. Starting with the basics, I quickly discovered the power of Excel macros to automate repetitive tasks. This not only expanded my skills but also sparked an excitement for technology.

### 🔥 Turning a Hobby into a Passion

Soon, I began using Excel to plan everyday tasks, as well as my short- and long-term personal development goals. Creating automated spreadsheets for personal use (like time management, to-do lists, trip expense planning, etc.) became a hobby I genuinely enjoyed.

### 💼 Combining Finance with Technology

While pursuing a career in finance, I realized the huge potential of combining finance with technology and big data. While finance was interesting, using technology to create financial models was truly exciting.

### 🛠️ Diving into New Tools

This led me to dive into Python and SQL, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, all through free online resources. I also picked up the basics of HTML and CSS for web development, which allowed me to build and host my personal website on GitHub Pages.

### 🚀 What I'm Doing Now

I'm passionate about using technology to streamline processes and solve real-world problems. I'm currently diving deeper into **Machine Learning** with Python, **Stanford CS229**, and exploring more advanced statistical concepts.

- 👋 Hi there! I'm Asher. 

- 📊 Coming from a background in finance and accounting, I initially stumbled into the realm of programming through Excel, when I wanted to create a tool that could predict EPL and NBA scores, as well as individual performances. Starting from the basics of Excel, I soon discovered the power of macros to automate repetitive tasks. This not only expanded my Excel skills but also further fueled my interest in programming. I soon began using it to plan out various everyday tasks and short and long term goals.

- 🎓 While pursuing a career in finance, I recognized the immense potential in combining it with technology and big data. This realization prompted me to explore online data analysis certificates, delving into tools like SQL and R.

- 🐍 Currently, I'm immersed in learning Python for financial modeling and analysis.

- 💡 I'm passionate about leveraging technology to streamline processes and solve real-world challenges. Thank you for joining me on this adventure.

# Hi there, I'm Asher ðŸ‘‹

I'm a finance professional turned tech enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.

## ðŸš€ My Journey

My journey into programming started unexpectedly. It all began when I wanted to create a tool to predict EPL and NBA scores using Excel. Starting with the basics, I quickly discovered the power of Excel macros to automate repetitive tasks. This not only expanded my skills but also sparked an excitement for technology. Soon, I began using Excel to plan everyday tasks, as well as my short- and long-term personal development goals. Creating automated spreadsheets for personal use (like time management, to-do lists, trip expense planning, etc.) became a hobby I genuinely enjoyed.

While pursuing a career in finance, I realized the huge potential of combining finance with technology and big data. While finance was interesting, using technology to create financial models was truly exciting. This led me to dive into Python and SQL, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, all through free online resources. I also picked up the basics of HTML and CSS for web development, which allowed me to build and host my personal website on GitHub Pages.

I'm passionate about using technology to streamline processes and solve real-world problems.
